# Bash Script to List Contents of /usr/local Directory

## Overview
This Bash script is designed to list the contents of the `/usr/local` directory. The script demonstrates the creation of custom Bash commands, focusing on setting up variables and iterating through a directory's contents without using external commands directly. When executed, the script generates a clean, single-column output of the directory's contents.

## Prerequisites
To use this script, you should have the following:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS).
- Bash shell (usually available by default).
- Sufficient permissions to access the `/usr/local` directory.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

1. Change your working directory to the project folder:
cd <project-folder>
2. Make the script executable:
chmod +x list_usr_local.sh
3. Run the script to list the contents of the /usr/local directory:
./list_usr_local.sh

The output will be displayed in your terminal or command prompt in a single-column format, listing the files and directories found in the /usr/local directory.

<b>Customization<b>
You can customize the script by changing the directory_path variable to point to a different directory if needed.
